    "* Assignment Expressions (the Walrus operator :=): This operator allows you to assign a value to a variable as part of an expression. It's often used in while-loops and list comprehensions to both assign and use a value in a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Positional-only Parameters: Python 3.8 introduced a syntax for defining function parameters as positional-only, which means they cannot be called using keyword arguments.\n",

    "* f-strings Improvements: Python 3.8 added support for the = specifier in f-strings to display both the expression and its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The math.prod() Function: This function was introduced to calculate the product of all the elements in an iterable.\n",
