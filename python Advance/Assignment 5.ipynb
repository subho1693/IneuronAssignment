    "Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming languages that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class or superclass. In other words, a class can have multiple base classes, and it inherits the characteristics of all of them. Multiple inheritance can lead to complex class hierarchies and require careful handling to avoid issues like the diamond problem."

    "Delegation is a design principle in object-oriented programming where one object forwards or delegates some of its responsibilities or behavior to another object. Instead of implementing all functionality directly, an object may delegate certain tasks to another object that specializes in handling those tasks. Delegation promotes code reuse, modularity, and separation of concerns."

When you call a method on an instance, it becomes a bound method because it is bound to that instance, and the instance is automatically passed as the first argument (typically named self) to the method. Bound methods allow you to access and manipulate the attributes of the specific instance they are bound to. Here's an example of using bound methods:"
