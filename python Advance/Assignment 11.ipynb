    "The concept of a metaclass in Python revolves around the idea of being the \"class of a class.\" In other words, a metaclass is responsible for defining the behavior and structure of classes themselves. In Python, everything is an object, including classes. Therefore, just as classes define the behavior and attributes of objects (instances), metaclasses define the behavior and attributes of classes."

    "Class decorators and metaclasses can overlap in some cases for handling classes. Both allow you to modify class definitions, add attributes, or change their behavior. However, they differ in how they achieve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Metaclasses: Metaclasses are a more powerful and flexible mechanism because they control the entire class creation process. You define a metaclass by creating a custom class that inherits from type and overrides its methods, such as __new__ or __init__. Metaclasses can enforce class-wide behavior and structure, affecting all instances of a class and its subclasses.\n",

    "* Class Decorators: Class decorators, applied using the @decorator syntax, are functions that take a class as input and return a modified class. They are typically used to add or modify attributes or methods in a class, but their scope is limited to the individual class they decorate. They are more suitable for specific, localized modifications to a class.\n",
