    "An abstract superclass, also known as an abstract base class (ABC), is a class in object-oriented programming that is designed to be inherited by other classes. However, it cannot be instantiated itself. Instead, it defines a common interface and potentially some abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses. The purpose of an abstract superclass is to provide a blueprint for its subclasses to ensure a certain level of consistency and structure in the derived classes."

    "To augment an inherited method without completely replacing it, you can use method overriding in the subclass. Method overriding involves defining a method in the subclass with the same name as a method in the superclass. Within the overridden method, you can call the superclass's method using the super() function, and then add or modify behavior as needed. This way, you extend or augment the functionality of the inherited method while still leveraging the original behavior from the superclass."

In contrast, a function defines its own local namespace, and variables defined within a function are not directly accessible from outside the function.\n",

    "* Lifetime: The attributes of a class have a longer lifetime than local variables in a function. Class attributes exist as long as the class definition is in scope, while local variables in a function have a limited lifetime within the function's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Accessibility: Class attributes and methods can be accessed from instances of the class or the class itself, depending on their visibility (public, protected, or private). In contrast, local variables in a function are only accessible within that function.\n",

    "* Purpose: Classes are used to define blueprints for creating objects, encapsulate data, and provide methods for object behavior. Functions are used for encapsulating logic, performing computations, and defining reusable blocks of code.\n",
