    "Ans:-An iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol, which consists of the __iter__() and __next__() methods. Iterators allow you to iterate over a sequence of elements, fetching one element at a time, and moving forward until the sequence is exhausted.Generators, on the other hand, are a convenient way to create iterators. They are defined using a special syntax with the yield keyword. Generator functions return a generator object when called, and the generator object can be iterated over using a for loop or by explicitly calling the next() function."
