    "def statements are used to define named functions that can be called later using the defined function name. They consist of the def keyword followed by the function name, a parameter list enclosed in parentheses, a colon, and a block of code indented below. def statements allow for multiple lines of code and have a return statement to specify the value returned by the function.\n",
    "Lambda expressions, also known as anonymous functions, are defined using the lambda keyword. They are used to create small, one-line functions without a function name. Lambda expressions can take any number of arguments, followed by a colon and an expression that is evaluated and returned as the result of the function.\n"

    "Ans:-Recursive functions are functions that call themselves during their execution. They are a powerful programming technique that allows solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, similar subproblems. The recursion continues until a base case is reached, at which point the function stops calling itself and returns a result. Recursive functions typically have two components: the base case(s), which define when the recursion should stop, and the recursive case(s), which define how the function calls itself with smaller subproblems.\n",
    "Recursive functions are used when a problem can be naturally divided into smaller instances of the same problem. Examples of problems that are commonly solved using recursion include traversing or searching tree-like data structures, performing mathematical calculations (e.g., factorial or Fibonacci sequence), and implementing algorithms like quicksort or depth-first search."

    "* Proper Naming: Choose meaningful and descriptive names for functions that accurately represent their purpose. This makes the code more readable and helps other developers understand the function's functionality without looking at its implementation.\n",

    "* Proper Error Handling: Functions should handle errors and exceptions gracefully. They should provide appropriate error messages or exceptions that give enough information to diagnose and debug problems.\n",

    "* Avoid Side Effects: Functions should ideally have no or minimal side effects, meaning they should not modify variables outside of their local scope unless necessary. This improves the predictability and maintainability of the code."

    "* Output Parameters: Functions can modify variables that are passed as arguments by reference. This allows the function to directly modify the values of the caller's variables.\n",
